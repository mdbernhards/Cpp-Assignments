Once upon a time, a bee named Buzzy went from flower to flower, collecting nectar.
He loved the sweet smell and texture of the flowers and the warm sun on his back.
One day, Buzzy found the most beautiful flower he had ever seen, and he knew it would contain the sweetest, most sticky honey.
He worked hard collecting nectar from that flower and returned home to share the news with his bee friends.
They all agreed it was the best honey they had ever seen and smelled, and they all lived happily ever after.
