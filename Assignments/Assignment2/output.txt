Once upon a time, a piggy named Buzzy went from puddle to puddle, wallowing in mud.
He loved the sweet smell and texture of the puddles and the warm sun on his back.
One day, Buzzy found the most beautiful puddle he had ever seen, and he knew it would contain the sweetest, most sticky gunky, smelly slime.
He worked hard wallowing in mud from that puddle and returned home to share the news with his piggy friends.
They all agreed it was the best gunky, smelly slime they had ever seen and smelled, and they all lived happily ever after.
